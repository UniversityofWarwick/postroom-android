Post room (Android)
===================

This is Post room (companion app) for Android. The app is, per request, a thin wrapper around a web application implemented using the CustomTabs framework. Some native functionality is implemented for reading university MIFARE cards.

It is used by estates staff to process received parcels and aid in picking up items for students calling in at the post room.

The app is written in Kotlin.
